# SUPER Board

SB is an app to create and share dynamic panels. It's still on the making.

## Try it

The site is hosted [here](https://kubixy.github.io/SUPER-Board/). It requieres registration that can be made through setting up and email and a password (requieres email verification) or using your Google account (doesn't need email verification). The account can be deleted from "My profile" and no data is kept after deletion.

Once your registration is complete, you'll be able to create your first board. On the left panel you'll find your ID board (so other users are able to find you), all components that can currently be added and the option to set the visibility of your board to public/private (public by default).

You can find other public boards by introducing their ID on "Find a board". Try 1010 to find a premade board.
